# Overview

This simple plugin helps you to insert a TODO item on your today's journal page, without navigating to it. This maybe useful when you are writing notes on one page, and suddenly want to add a task item regarding a separate matter. Instead of going to your daily page and adding the task there, this plugin allows you to add it using the command palatte.

# Installation

Please install from the marketplace. If it's not available there, you can [download the latest release here](https://github.com/hkgnp/logseq-quicktodo-plugin/releases), unzip the file and manually load it into Logseq.

# Usage

To start using, either activate using:

- The command palatte (Win: `Ctrl + Shift + p`, Mac: `Cmd + Shift + p`) and type `quick`, and the option `Quick todo to today's journal page` will appear.

or

- Use the shortcut, "m t".

## Adding to today's journal page

Simply key in your item and press `Enter`.

## Adding to page mentioned in task

If you would like for the task to be in a mentioned page, e.g. `Plan party for [[Acme Company]]` to go to the page `[[Acme Company]]`, press `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` instead of just `Enter` after keying in your item.

## Adding to default page

If a default page is specified in the plugin settings, items will **not** be added to the today's journal page, but to do the default page specified.
